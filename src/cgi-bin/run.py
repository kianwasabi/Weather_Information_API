# !! For LOCAL WSGI server usage !!
# NOTES: Do not use app.run() & print() in production.
# Moreover app.run() is fine to use in production as long as it is contained 
# in an if __name__ == '__main__': block. This is because most 
# production http servers do not execute this block. 
# Therefore, run.py & config.py are only meant for development on a local machine.  
# !! The flask application is executed in production with the routes.py file. 

# from config import *
# from routes import *

# def main(): 
#     app.run(hostIP, port, debug=True)
#     # try: 
#     #     app.run(hostIP, port, debug=True)
#     #     print("ðŸ«¡ Server started")
#     # except Exception as err:
#     #     print (f"Starting Server failed - Error: {err}")

# if __name__ == '__main__':
#     main()
